        <h2>My hobby as a gamer and some of the games i play</h2>

        <p class="informasion">One of my hobbies I can say has a pretty big impact on my,

            childhood and on my life to this day,

            I wasn't that big when I was introduced to gaming,

            and i fell very hard for the  fantasy world that comes in all kinds of forms and the music for the games,

            my first gaming machine was the sega mega 16 drive with the game sonic,

            and from there it evolved from sega to nitendo to playstation to pc.

            coming home during the day and being able to jump into a fantasy world,

            is very soothing and a nice thing to forget the world for a few hours

            I am quite a big gamer and play almost every possible game,

            and am a big fan of final fantasy and legend of zelda.

        <h2>Monster Hunter</h2>
        
        <p class="informasion">Monster hunter is an Action role-playing where you hunt big bad monsters,

            quite fun when you play in a team with friends and it is a game that requires  that you have a good reaction,

            you couldn't get the game in the west until 2018,

            when it came to ps4 and then to pc it was held in japan because they weren't sure if the western players would like it,

            my first monster hunter was world which i first got on ps4,

             but when it came on pc i went to pc for monster hunter instead.

            The game has an magical world and a fantastic story following with some awesome music.

        <h2>Final Fantasy</h2>

        <p class="informasion">Final Fantasy is one of the games I grew up with and am quite a big fan of the game series,

            I play final fantasy 14 myself and do fights on the second most difficult level called savage tier.

            It's quite fun but can give you a bit of PTSD when you've done the boss quite a few times,

             some of thos that are a trigger for me are (hello world) alpha beta and delta blameing the omega raid for that.

            a fantastic world with wonderful storytelling with lots of good music,

             for places you can visit to small fights to big boss battles themes.

            the community for ffxiv is aswell a really posetiv and loveing part of the game.

            ffxiv is aswell geting there 5 expension next year.

        <p class="informasion">Old but gold, another game I grew up with. 
            
            Zelda is a game that I can say definitely taught me to love exploration and adventure in games.</p>
